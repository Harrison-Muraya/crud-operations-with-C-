# CRUD Operations Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using C# programming language. CRUD operations are fundamental actions for managing data in a database or any persistent storage system. This project provides a simple console application to perform these operations on a sample data entity.

## Features

- Read: Retrieves and displays existing records from the database.
- Update: Modifies existing records in the database.
- Delete: Removes records from the database.

## Prerequisites
- .NET SDK installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
